# React Email

Emails are a different kind of beast. Not every fancy CSS trick you put in works. We built this components' library depending on how Email clients want it. For a start, all the styles are compiled into inline styles. But you do not have to worry about putting styles inline. Our library provides great Developer Experience with easy-to-use mechanisms to let you define the styles as usual but turned to inlined styles at the end of the day when you send the emails. Also, you don't need to worry about the styling and HTML tags guidelines for different email clients, use our components and leave the handling of compatibility to us.

# üì∂ About

A React-Based component and utility method-based lightweight library to provide a common interface for email building that users can install and use to build clean and responsive email easily.

# üìç React Email Components

A collection of React components to help build consistent cross-client emails. As well as the layout components, there is a function that inlined your styles before the page is rendered.

Note: This was built for a Stylus workflow, additional work will have to be done to get this working with vanilla CSS or another preprocessor.

# üî∞ Getting started

ReactEmailComponents is split up into two modules:

- react-email-components
- react-email-components-stylus
  Although they are both necessary, their setup is entirely different and therefore separated. To get started, follow the steps below for each.

# ‚ùáÔ∏è Installation

## react-email-components

this module contains all of the React components necessary to get ReactEmailComponents to work.

Install using NPM or Yarn:

```bash
 npm install @leopardslab/react-email
```

```bash
npm install react-email-components
```

Import the desired components into your React app:

```javascript
import { Container, Block, Row, Column, Spacer } from 'react-email-components';
```

## react-email-components-stylus

This module contains the Stylus mixins and functions necessary to get ReactEmailComponents to work.

Install using NPM or Yarn:

```bash
npm install react-email-components-stylus
```

### Require the Stylus module in your main stylesheet:

```bash
@require 'react-email-components-stylus'
```

# üõû Dependencies

ReactEmailComponents depends on the following libraries:

- "@leopardslab/react-email": "^1.15.3"
- "react": "^18.2.0"
- "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
- "nodemailer": "^6.7.8"
- "tslib": "^2.4.0"

\*\* Note, use the latest version of the above libraries.

# üìå Usage

## Create your Email Layout :

- Starting with a blank project

All the layouts are created in typescript and are exported as a react component. You can use the layouts as a base for your email.

### Create your Email Template :

```typescript
import { Email, Typography } from '@leopardslab/react-email';

export const EmailTemplate = ({ name }: { name: string }) => {
  return (
    <Email>
      <Typography>
        <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
        <h1>Heading 1</h1>
        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <p>Paragraph</p>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">Link</a>
      </Typography>
    </Email>
  );
};
```

```
* rap the entire return statement in a <Email> component
```

# üí† Components

### Emails

The Email component is the root component for all emails. It is responsible for setting the default styles for the email and inlining the styles before the page is rendered.

### Typography

The Typography component is a wrapper for all of the typography components. It is responsible for setting the default styles for the typography components.

## Section

The Section component is a wrapper for all of the layout components. It is responsible for setting the default styles for the layout components.

## Column

The Column component is a wrapper as Column under the Section component. It is responsible for setting the default styles for the Column components.

## Button

The Button component for defining a button in the email. It is responsible for setting the default styles for the button..

## Image

The Image component for defining a image in the email. It is responsible for setting the default styles for the image.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Component Stylings:

## 1) Adding parameters inside the component to change the style of the component.

This should be done in the following way:

```css
classes= {
   {
    root: {
      margin: '10px 0 20px 0';
    }
  }
}
```

Example:

```TypeScript
<Email>
      <Section>
        <Column>
          <Typography classes={{root: {margin: "10px 0 20px 0"}}}  variant="h2">
                Hello
          </Typography>
        </Column>
      </Section>
</Email>
```

## 2) Using "MakeStyles" to change the style of the component.

This should be done in the following way:

```css
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  title: {
    color: "red",
  },
  paragraph: {
    color: "blue",
  },
});

/* add the hook in the export function */

const styles = useStyles();

```

# Generate Email Template

- Add a file Generate.js in the root directory of the project.

```JavaScript
const { writeFileSync } = require('fs');
const {autoConfig} = require ("./config.js");
const {
  generateEmail,
  generateTextEmailFromHTML,
  validateEmail,
} = require("@leopardslab/react-email");
const { EmailTemplate } = require("./lib/cjs");

const html = generateEmail(EmailTemplate({ name: "John" }));
writeFileSync("./index.html", html);

const text = generateTextEmailFromHTML(html);

console.log(text);
```

\*\*Importing "EmailTemplate" that you have created [Email Layout](#create-your-email-template)

# Inspiration

The idea of a React Component Library for Emails is not novel. There have been other implementations around for a while and we were inspired a lot by these solutions and many other generic Component Libraries. Following are a few of the amazing other implementations.

We try to be the community backed up-to-date solution one can depend on and contribute back, request features & seek help.
